Exploring and applying data science techniques to a Housing dataset to predict price of the house

House price prediction is a common problem in the real estate industry and involves predicting the selling price of a house based on various features and attributes. 
The problem is typically approached as a regression problem, where the target variable is the price of the house, and the features are various attributes of 
the house. The features used in house price prediction can include both quantitative and categoricalvariables, such as the number of bedrooms, house area, 
bedrooms, furnished, nearness to main road, and various amenities such as a garage and other factors that may influence the value of the property. 
Accurate predictions can help agents and appraisers price homes correctly, while homeowners can use the predictions to set a reasonable asking price for their 
properties. Accurate house price prediction can also be useful for buyers who are looking to make informed decisions about purchasing a property and obtaining 
a fair price for their investment.
